  @maven_project
  Scenario: Can create Maven Project for Spring Boot 2.2.8                  # features/spring_boot_website_maven_project.feature:7
    Given I am at the Spring Initializer website "https://start.spring.io/" # features/steps/spring_boot_website_create_project.py:5
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "/home/student/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/behave/model.py", line 1329, in run
          match.run(runner.context)

      Captured stdout:
      <behave.runner.Context object at 0x7f1b3ec27ac8>

    When I create a Spring boot with the following attributes               # None
      | project | language | version | group          | artifact  | description | packaging | java_version |
      | Maven   | Kotlin   | 2.2.8   | com.drkiettran | my_kotlin | testing     | war       | 11           |
    Then I should receive a zip file                                        # None
    And the file should contain a build.gradle file with version "2.2.8"    # None
